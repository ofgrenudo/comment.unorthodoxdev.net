## comment.unorthodoxdev.net

Currently, my blog is made using hugo. The theme that I am using has the capability to enable comments, although they would all be hosted on a third party. Unfortunately for me, im unwilling to signup for said third parties. One saturday morning as I was drinking my coffee and browsing the blogs that I follow, landed on a favorite of mine: https://blog.ari-web.xyz/.

I really love ari's blog. I think that Ari does what the web was supposed to do and really embodies the the nature of blogging. Something that I aspire to do. But am too introverted to even post things about my self online, personally I get too wrapped up in making sure everything is perfect, that when I do get the urge to post something I post it and avoid my computer for the rest of the day in fear of finding a misspelled word (which happens more often than not). 

One of the features of Ari's blog that I really like is the https://user.ari-web.xyz/ section. Its a comment board that anyone can post to anon or not. While i havent looked at what Ari's comment section was written in, im planning on writing this comment section in rust. My goal for now is to seperate the project into two secions

**Binary**: comment.unorthodoxdev.net
**Library**: cmanager (Comments Manager)

The **Binary** will contain the code related to the web hooks and buisness logic.

The **Library** will contain the code that will store said comments into a JSON file or whatever database I decide to use (a JSON file).

Below now, I will copy ari's rules, with abit of a twist.

### Rules

- No stealing or impersonating usernames. Come up with something origional, it can be anything like stinkyBUTfarts6987
- Everything discussed on this comment section must be legal, and of decent nature. Something **___I___** could say around **___MY___** grandmother. Not you to yours.
- No harrassment, bullying, or slurs.
- Minimal to no advertising in the comments.
- No spam.

Breaking any of the above rules, will result in the deletion of your comment and or and ban if needed. In extreme cases, comments could be reported to the authorities if I deem the need to.

### Advice

Even if you see a comment from someone who claims to be me, do not belive that the comment _was_ from me. This is a public commenting board and anyone could imperosonate anyone else. The things that are posted here, are not and cannot be tied to me or anyone else in any way other than IP.

Thanks for reading :)
