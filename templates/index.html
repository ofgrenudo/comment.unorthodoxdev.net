        <p>My site currently is ran via hugo, a static site generator. One feature I miss of my previous blog was the comment abillity, but now with hugo, for me to get comments I would need to sign up for some ooey gooey third party provider. Because im lazy, and would rather not give out my content / information to third party providers, nor would I like to put out my clients (you all, reading this) data out onto the interwebs, ill build a solution to self host a comment board.</p>
        <p>While everything in this comment board, I hand programmed for many sleepless months (aproximately 3 days before getting to production) I took alot of inspiration from one of my favorite ringnet blogs <a href="https://user.ari-web.xyz/">https://user.ari-web.xyz/</a>. I absolutely love the idea of a comment board that anyone can post too. I also love the way that Ari uses it and I hope to use it in a similar way.</p>
        <h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
        <p>Things I collect</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Your IP Address</li>

            <li>- Your Comment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Posting on the comment board, means you automatically agree to the creation, storage, and public placement of your comment on this site. If you wish to remove your comments, please email me. Or comment here, using the same IP that you used previously, and in the comment please leave a message containing the reason you want your comment deleted as well as the time stamp or ID of the comment. If for anyreason you cannot connect to the same IP  you used to comment, I will hide the comment but it will not be deleted. Depending on the nature of the comment I may remove it ultimately, but it is up to my discretion.</p>
        <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
        <p>Breaking any of the below rules and or content limitaions, will result in the deletion of your comment and or and ban if needed. In extreme cases, comments could be reported to the authorities if I deem the need to.        </p>        
        <ul>
            <li>- No stealing or impersonating usernames. Come up with something original, it can be anything like <b>stinkyBUTfarts6987</b></li>
            <li>- Everything discussed on this comment section must be legal, and of decent nature. Something <b><i><u>I</u></i></b> could say around <b><i><u>MY</u></i></b> grandmother. Not you to yours.</li>
            <li>- No harrassment, bullying, or slurs.</li>
            <li>- Minimal to no advertising in the comments.</li>
            <li>- No spam.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="comment_limitations">Content Limitaions</h3>
        <p>If your comment did not post, you should check here and ensure that you are not above any of the following limitations. The text box should stop you at the below lengths, but just in  case it doesnt, or your using the API. Here are the limitations within my library.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Usernames must be under 500 characters</li>
            <li>- Comments must be under 10,000 characters</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="advice">Advice</h2>
        <p><b><u>Even if you see a comment from someone who claims to be me, do not belive that the comment was from me or anyone else</u></b>. This is a public commenting board and anyone could imperosonate anyone else. The things that are posted here, are not and cannot be tied to me or anyone else in any way other than IP. Even then, things can be spoofed.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading :)</p>
