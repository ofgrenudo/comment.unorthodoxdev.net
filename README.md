# About

My site currently is ran via hugo, a static site generator. One feature I miss of my previous blog was the comment abillity, but now with hugo, for me to get comments I would need to sign up for some ooey gooey third party provider. Because im lazy, and would rather not give out my content / information to third party providers, nor would I like to put out my clients (you all, reading this) data out onto the interwebs, ill build a solution to self host a comment board.

While everything in this comment board, I hand programmed for many sleepless months (aproximately 3 days before getting to production) I took alot of inspiration from one of my favorite ringnet blogs https://user.ari-web.xyz/. I absolutely love the idea of a comment board that anyone can post too. I also love the way that Ari uses it and I hope to use it in a similar way.

## Advice

Even if you see a comment from someone who claims to be me, do not belive that the comment was from me or anyone else. This is a public commenting board and anyone could imperosonate anyone else. The things that are posted here, are not and cannot be tied to me or anyone else in any way other than IP. Even then, things can be spoofed.
